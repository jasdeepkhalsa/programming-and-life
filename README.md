## Programming & Life ##
A poetic expression of JavaScript and life as I see it.

It is also, I think, a fantastic way to introduce core JavaScript programming concepts to those new to the language.

Programming is a beautiful lens through which to see life because life is full of tests, variables, cycles, patterns and interdependence.

However, no work of art would be complete without a preamble that first sets the tone of what's to come, so here goes...

### Preamble ###

    Whilst you are alive, whilst you have breaths, you have the form of the body which exists inside the spirit.
    
    The spirit is forever, the body is perishable.
    
    The success of your life depends upon your perspective and your ability to manage your emotions.
    
    If you can come from a wider perspective and be more inclusive, your relationships with others will flourish.

    If you can manage your emotions and not react but act, your relationships with others will flourish.

    Relationships are the cornerstone of life, their flourishing is directly proportional to your success and happiness.
    
    This includes your relationship to yourself, your parents, friends, family, significant others, nature and the Universe.
